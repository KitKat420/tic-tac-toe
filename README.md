# tic-tac-toe

So far the hardest project I've made as of 1/17/22. The code isn't in the best of shape but the program works.

## History

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## tic-tac-toe functionality 

This verison of tic tac toe involves a two player system; a win condition, & a game board that displays via the terminal.
